                <h2>Below is the schedule for the SECCDC</h2>
                <ul>
				  <li>1) Submit Email of intent:&nbsp;<br>
				  Institutions interested in fielding a team should submit an email letter of intent to compete to infosec@kennesaw.edu, as soon as possible, preferably by midnight Jan 26, 2018. <br><br>
				  <strong>Emails of intent will not be accepted after Feb. 16, 2018</strong>.&nbsp; <br><br>
				  The email letter of intent need only include the name of the institution, and the names and email addresses of the primary and secondary institutional representatives - who MUST be faculty or staff employees of the institution. Please note: an email of intent does NOT guarantee a place in the competition, only the registration fee does, as described below. Do not allow students to email us directly.<br><br>
				  </li>
				  <li>2) Submit Registration Fee:<br>
					There is only one fee for the CCDC which includes&nbsp;both the qualifier and the on-site competitions.&nbsp; Institutions that do not qualify for the onsite competition (the top 8 teams) will NOT receive a refund. For institutions competing for the first time ever in a CCDC event, there is a one-time registration discount.&nbsp; Institutions can register by credit card at the following <a href="https://epay.kennesaw.edu/C20923_ustores/web/store_cat.jsp?STOREID=51&amp;CATID=335">link</a>&nbsp;. Institutions paying by check should submit proof of check or check request by email to infosec@kennesaw.edu.&nbsp;<br>
					<br>
					The first 33 teams to submit a confirmed registration payment will be assigned&nbsp;a spot in the Prelim.&nbsp; The next three teams submitting confirmed registration payments will be held as alternates, in the event one of the first 33 teams drops out. Alternate teams not be selected for the competition will have payment refunded. Any payments not received by midnight Feb 16, will remove the team from competition. Team selection is on a first come, first served payment received basis.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
					<br>
					Schedule of registration fees is as follows:<br>
					First time participant registration fee:&nbsp;&nbsp;$150<br>
					Early registration (by midnight Jan 26, 2018):&nbsp;&nbsp;$300<br>
					Regular registration (by midnight Feb 9, 2018):&nbsp;&nbsp;$350<br>
				  Late registration (by midnight Feb 16, 2018):&nbsp; &nbsp;$400<br><br>
				  </li>
				  <li>3) Access SECCDC Portal and submit team roster:<br>
					Upon receipt of email of intent, institutional representatives will receive information to access the SECCDC Moodle portal where they can download and submit required documentation including the team roster spreadsheet and rules compliance form.&nbsp; All documents must be uploaded to the SECCDC portal by the deadlines specified there.&nbsp; Failure to meet the deadlines will result in team removal.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
					<br>
					Once the deadline for the submission of the official team roster to the SECCDC Portal has passed, no changes TO the roster are allowed, but changes WITHIN the roster can be made up until the start of competition - both for the qualifier and the regional. The final roster submitted is fixed with regard to the names on the roster, for the duration of the entire CCDC&nbsp;season.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
					<br>
					The list of active competitors (the 8 students from the 12 student roster who will actually participate in the competition) may be decided as late as the start of the competition by notifying the local room judge upon arrival for the Prelim.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
					<br>
				  When available, team packets will be provided through the SECCDC portal.&nbsp; For any other questions, please email us at infosec@kennesaw.edu.&nbsp;<br>
				  <br>
				  </li>
				  <li>4) Identify&nbsp; Local IT Pro as Room Judge:<br>
						  Each team is required to recruit one or two on-site room judges who will verify students against the roster provided as well as proctor the team at their competition site.&nbsp; Upload the on-site room judge's contact information to the SECCDC Portal as soon as confirmed, and no later than the date indicated. This person MUST NOT&nbsp;be employed by the institution and should be a qualified IT professional with a reasonable level of network, systems, and security knowledge. Failure to provide&nbsp;a suitable room judge by the deadline indicated in the Portal is grounds for removal from the competition.<br><br>
				  </li>
				  <li>5) Establish local competition resource and compete in the Prelim:&nbsp;<br>
						The first event as part of the SECCDC Regional process is the virtual preliminary&nbsp;qualification competition (a.k.a. the Prelim), currently scheduled for Feb 24th, conducted remotely from a computer lab or other facility on the institution&rsquo;s home campus.&nbsp; Each team will compete by logging into a remote NetLab system as well as the SECCDC email server.<br>
						<br>
				  There will be two to three prelim sessions on this date, each lasting approximately 4 hours,&nbsp;on a schedule to be provided later.&nbsp; Teams will be notified as to their competition time. The top 8 teams will progress to the on-site regional, and should be notified within 1 week.<br><br>
				  </li>
				  <li>6) Compete in On-site Regional (Apr 2 &amp; 3):<br>
					The on-site competition will be held at KSU in the Burruss Building, Kennesaw Campus, on Monday, April 2nd and Tuesday, April 3th.&nbsp; The eight teams with the highest performance during the Prelim will be invited to the on-site competition.&nbsp; A schedule will be provided later.&nbsp; &nbsp;While we will make every effort to provide hotel rooms for the on-site teams, space is again very limited, so invited teams will be provided with a limited number of dual-occupancy rooms. Institutions that do not make the on-site competition are encouraged to send faculty or staff volunteers to serve as room judges in order to gain insights into preparing teams for future competitions. Unfortunately, there is no travel support for volunteers, but some&nbsp;on-site meals will be provided.<br>
				  </li>
					<li>Schedule for April 2, 2018<br>08:30 Teams check-in, BB 151, 
					Kennesaw State University, Kennesaw Campus<br>09:00 Welcome and 
					in-brief<br>10:00 Start of Competition Day 1<br>20:00 End of
